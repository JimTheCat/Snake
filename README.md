# Snake
Simple Snake written in Java in Swing Framework.

# How to use?

Snake don't need any extensions.
While you download a project just run it in your IDE.

# Funcionality
In this application you can:
* Choose size of map
* Turn on/off hardmode (it means collision blocks randomly generated on the map)

When you run application first of all you have to choose size of map and turn on/off hardmode.
Secondly you just play ^^. Your highscore is saved to **highscore.txt**.
Is that simple :3

# TODO
* Split application to JPanels instead of one.
* Add more sprites.
* Add icon to frame.
* Refactor code .
